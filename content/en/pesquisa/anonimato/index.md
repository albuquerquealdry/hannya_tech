## Overview

Online anonymity aims to protect user identity from various tracking vectors, from network metadata to behavioral signals. This research consolidates techniques, tools, and operational security (OPSEC) practices to raise privacy without compromising usability.

## Ethical Considerations

Anonymity safeguards free speech and vulnerable groups, but can be abused. The analysis weighs legitimate uses, mitigations, and responsible recommendations.

## Next Steps

- Refine the threat model for regional scenarios.
- Test mixnets under high-traffic conditions.
- Document an OPSEC guide applicable to newsrooms.

## References

- RFCs and academic literature on network metadata.
- Tor documentation and VPN comparisons.
- Recommended data minimization practices.
